            <small style="text-align: left;">The image above shows the number of protected areas that have increased over ther years.</small>
            <P> Ever since the first opening of a national park, Banff national park(protected area) canada has put much effort in creating more over years to sustain the nature of these areas. A graph above shows the growth of the number of parks and conservation reserve systems over the years. Note* this graph starts in 1890, 5 years after the first park opened.</P>
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium';">The Different Between Conservation and Protection</h3>
            <p>Conservation refers to the tools we use to achieve the health and biodiversity of land. Protection refers to the creation of parks in these areas in order to directly protect them from industrial activities, which helps their ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Canada must have laws in place to ensure the protection and conservation of these areas. Using the jurisdiction canada has in most of these areas, certain laws have  been created and enforced based off of the jurisdictions</p> 
            <p>According to the Government of Canada official website economic, social, and environmental matters need to be considered in order to place these laws such as land usage, habitat protection and most importantly it requires the interest and consideration of first nation people</p>
